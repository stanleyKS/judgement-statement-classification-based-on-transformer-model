1,"In the present facts, it is clear that BCCL and India have laid recourse to Clauses of the NIT, whether it be to
justify condonation of delay of Respondent No. 6 in submitting performance bank guarantees or their decision to
resume auction on grounds of technical failure. BCCL having authored these documents, is better placed to
appreciate their requirements and interpret them. (Afcons Infrastructure Ltd. v. Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.,
(2016) 16 SCC 818) The High Court ought to have deferred to this understanding, unless it was patently perverse or mala fide. Given how BCCL's interpretation of these clauses was plausible and not absurd, solely differences in opinion of contractual
interpretation ought not to have been grounds for the High Court to come to a finding that the appellant committed
illegality.""",Respondent
2,"It is true that the ARC is not a party-respondent. It need not be. It is an assignee of YBL. If YBL
has dropped the Wilful Defaulter proceedings, and, on affidavit withdrawn the First Committee
order and both underlying show cause notices, it is difficult to see how these can continue or inure
to the ARC. We leave open the question of whether the ARC is independently entitled in law to maintain wilful
defaulter proceedings against the Petitioners under the 1st July 2015 Master Circular of the Reserve
Bank of India (""RBI"").The Writ Petitions are disposed of in these terms. There will be no order as to costs.",Ambiguity
3,"Hence, it has to be directed that till such amendment is made to the down the Explanation to
Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961, all individuals domiciled in Sikkim up to 26 th April, 1975
shall be entitled to the exemption under the said provision from the current financial year i.e., 1st
April, 2022 onwards. This direction is being issued in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the
Constitution so as to eliminate discrimination and disparity in respect of the aforesaid category of
Sikkimese, who subsequently have become citizens of India w.e.f. 26th April, 1975 and to save the
Explanation from being rendered unconstitutional vis-à-vis such individuals who form a small
percentage of Sikkimese and who are also entitled to such an exemption. Such as approach is being
adopted rather than striking down the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961 which
would have the effect of withdrawing the benefit of exemption even from those categories of persons
who are presently eligible for the same.
i) That the benefit of income-tax exemption presently is restricted only to those
Sikkimese who fall within the three clauses of the Explanation to Section 10(26AAA)
of the I.T. Act, 1961, or those persons domiciled in Sikkim, or are Sikkimese as
covered under the 1961 Regulation.
ii) In terms of the Sikkim (Citizenship) Order, 1975 as amended by the Sikkim (Citizenship)
Amendment Order, 1989, issued by the Government of India any person who was a Sikkim Subject
under the 1961 Regulation was to be deemed to be a citizen of India w.e.f. 26th April, 1975.
Conversely, it is held that all citizens of India, having a domicile in Sikkim on the day it merged with
India i.e. 26th April, 1975 must be covered under the Explanation in order to avail the benefit of the
exemption under Section 10(26AAA) of the I.T. Act, 1961.
iii) The Union of India shall make an amendment to Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of I.T. Act,
1961, so as to suitably include a clause to extend the exemption from payment of income tax to all
Indian citizens domiciled in Sikkim on or before 26 th April, 1975. The reason for such a direction is
to save the explanation from unconstitutionality and to ensure parity in the facts and circumstances
of the case.
iv) Till such amendment is made by the Parliament to the Explanation to Section 10 (26AAA) of I.T.
Act, 1961, any individual whose name does not appear in the Register of Sikkim Subjects but it is
established that such individual was domiciled in Sikkim on or before 26th April, 1975, shall be
entitled to the benefit of exemption.",Petitioner
4,"In view of above, we are inclined to allow this petition, because simplicitor registration of FIR/s
by itself cannot C/SCA/25314/2022 ORDER DATED: 05/01/2023 have any nexus with the breach
of maintenance of public order and the authority cannot have recourse under the Act and no other
relevant and cogent material exists for invoking power under section 3(2) of the Act. In the result,
the present petition is hereby allowed and the impugned order of detention No.PCB/
DTN/PASA/865 of 2022 dated 24.09.2022 passed by the respondent-detaining authority is hereby
quashed and set aside. The detenue is ordered to be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any
other case.",Petitioner
5,"In the facts of the said case, the Court found that there was, in fact, a confessional statement of
the disclosure made by the appellant Gurbachan Singh which was confirmed by the recovery of the
incriminating articles. As such, the Court believed the disclosure statement and the evidence led in
that behalf. As already stated hereinabove, in the present case, there is no confessional statement of
Boby (accused No.3/appellant herein) recorded with regard to recovery of the dead body of the
deceased.
In the result, the appeal is allowed.
The judgment dated 18th December 2004 passed by the trial Court, thereby convicting the
appellant under Sections 395, 365, 364, 201, 380, 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC and the
impugned judgment dated 25th August 2008, passed by the High Court affirming the same are set

6,"The learned counsel for the petitioner desires to withdraw the writ petition in view of the judgment
passed by the Supreme Court dated 18.08.2022 in Civil Appeal Nos. 5509-5510 of 2022 in the
matter of Brij Raj Oberoi vs. The Secretary, Tourism and Civil Aviation Department & Anr. Not
objected by the learned counsel for the State-respondents. The petitioner is permitted to withdraw
the writ petition. The writ petition stands withdrawn.",Ambiguity
7,"Keeping in view the unrebutted testimony of PW1 and documents relied upon, it can be said that
the plaintiff has duly established its case that defendant has unlawfully withheld the amount due to
the plaintiff which the plaintiff in entitled to recover. Further since defendant no. 2 stood
surety/guarantor to the loan facility availed by defendant no.1, his liability being co-extensive, the
plaintiff is also entitled to recover the alleged amount from defendant no. 2 in alternate or together
with defendant no.1. Now though the statement of accounts Ex PW1/7 reflect a liability of
Rs.2,21,188/- pending on part of the defendant, plaintiff has sought recovery for Rs. 2,18,284/- only.
 In view of the above discussion, therefore, the suit of the plaintiff is decreed. The plaintiff is
awarded decree for recovery of Rs. 2,18,284/- along with cost of suit along with prayed interest @
13.70 % per annum from the date of filing of the suit till the date of realization of the amount
decreed.",Petitioner

previous period. In doing so, and having regard to this correspondence, the IOB will be required to
give the Petitioner adequate notice and a brief hearing to show cause. We require this because the
conduct of the IOB in correspondence thus far has been less than satisfactory. IOB is required to update its records to reclassify the Petitioner and remove the classification as
an NPA. This is to be done within 48 hours of this order being uploaded.",Petitioner

10,"There appears prima facie some merit in the submission made by learned counsel for the
petitioners that the respondents cannot replace contractual arrangement of a similar arrangement.

12,"The writ
petition thus suffers from unexplained delay and laches. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the claim of
the petitioners has been examined and we have not found any legal right in their favour to direct the
Company to grant them the reliefs as prayed for. 05] The decisions relied upon by the learned
counsel for the petitioners do not support the claim as made in the writ petition. Since the Company
was under the process of financial reconstruction in the light of the provisions of the Act of 1985, the
ratio of the aforesaid decisions cannot be applied to the case in hand. The selection of the cut of date
of 01.04.2018 for granting pay revision is not under challenge and hence nothing further is required
to be said in that regard. 06] Hence for aforesaid reasons, we do not find any case is made out to
grant relief to the petitioners. The writ petition stands dismissed. The Rule stands discharged. No
costs.",Respondent
13,"As per settled position of law laid down by this Court in a catena of
decisions, an award can be set aside only if the award is against the
public policy of India. The award can be set aside under Sections 34/37
of the Arbitration Act, if the award is found to be contrary to, (a)
fundamental policy of Indian Law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c)
justice or morality; or (d) if it is patently illegal. None of the aforesaid
exceptions shall be applicable to the facts of the case on hand. The High
Court has entered into the merits of the claim and has decided the
appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act as if the High Court was
deciding the appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the
learned trial Court. Thus, the High Court has exercised the jurisdiction
not vested in it under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act. The impugned
judgment and order passed by the High Court is hence not sustainable.
In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present
appeal succeeds. The impugned judgment and order passed by the
High Court is hereby quashed and set aside. The award passed by the
arbitrator and the order passed by the Additional District Judge under
Section 34 of the Arbitration Act overruling the objections are hereby
restored.",Petitioner
14,"With the aforesaid directions, the present application accordingly stands disposed off. The
applicant/petitioner is directed to get this order served upon the respondent through electronic
modes i.e. email and Whatsapp within 7 days from today and file its affidavit of compliance on
record, alongwith the proof of service, on the aforesaid dedicated email ID of the court within 10
days from today.",Respondent
15,"In our view this is neither the correct approach nor borne out of the
record. Evidence was led. Even earlier, the material in respect of other
charges emanates from the record of the bank which shows the conduct
of the respondent which are apparent from the manner of framing of the
charges themselves and the material led in support thereof. Thus, even
the aspect of the other charges could not have been brushed aside in the
manner it purports to. On the matter being remitted back, two witnesses
deposed as to these aspects, being MW-3 and MW-4. The respondent
was a clerk-cum-cashier. It is a post of confidence. The respondent
breached that confidence. In fact, the respondent breached the trust of a
widowed sister-in-law as well as of the bank, making it hardly a case for
interference either on law or on moral grounds. The punishment imposed
on the respondent could also hardly be said to be disproportionate. The
conduct established of the respondent did not entitle him to continue in
service.
We are, thus, of the view that the impugned judgment dated
31.5.2018 of the High Court is liable to be set aside and the challenge to
the award of the Industrial Tribunal dated 21.2.2013 is repelled.",Petitioner
16,"For the reasons aforestated the appellants have miserably failed to establish that on the date the
decrees were passed, the appellants were the co-owners of the property at 38, Koregaon Park, Pune.
They further failed to establish that they have any independent source of income and they have
contributed for purchase of the property at 38, Koregaon Park, Pune, from their own independent
income. Further the appellants failed to discharge the burden of proving that the appellants have a
share in the property. The other connected issues are only consequential to this issue and it may not
be necessary for us to deal with them in view of our decision above. Accordingly, the appeal fails and
is dismissed with costs.",Respondent
17,"The High Court did not even consider the import of Section 34 IPC as against A3
and A4. We find that the approach of the trial court cannot be sustained to that
extent in the light of our discussion. Thus, we are inclined to set aside the
judgment of the High Court confirming that of the trial court as against the
Accused-Appellants namely A3 and A4 alone are concerned.

18,"The learned counsel appearing for the respondent bank submits that Ext.P8 request is for

judgment is upheld. We endorse the view taken by the learned Single
Judge that after amendment of the Reservation Act, the respondent No. 1 –
University had to follow the reservation norms of 2% for SC candidates,
31% for ST candidates and 17% for OBC candidates which is in
consonance with the second proviso to Section 3 of the Reservation Act

20,"On our finding that there was no monitoring whatsoever of the purchase of shares made on behalf of
the Caparo Group of Companies by the Punjab National Bank and on our further finding that
though the Reserve Bank of India was not actuated by malice and was not guilty of non-application
of mind, the reliance placed by the Reserve Bank of India on the Punjab National Bank was
misplaced in the event, the Punjab National Bank having totally abandoned its duties as authorised
dealer, it follows that the permission granted by the Reserve Bank must be reconsidered by the
Reserve Bank in the light of the failure of the Punjab National Bank to discharge its duties.
Therefore, while allowing the appeals of the Union of India, the Reserve Bank of India and the Life
Insurance Corporation of India and dismissing the appeal of Escorts Limited and setting aside the
judgment of the High Court, we direct the Reserve Bank of India to make a full and detailed enquiry
into the purchase of shares of Escorts Limited by the Caparo Group of Companies and consider
afresh the question whether permission ought or ought not to have been granted. 
We also direct the Reserve Bank of India to enquire into the conduct of Punjab National Bank and
take such action as may be necessary including cancellation of the authorisation granted under sec.
6 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. In regard to costs, the Union of India, the Reserve Bank
of India and the Life Insurance Corporation of India are certainly entitled to their costs. We do not
see any reason why the company Escorts Limited should be mulcted with costs. The litigation was
launched by Mr. Nanda and he should be personally made liable for the costs. We also think that the
litigation has been unnecessarily complicated by the failure of Mr. Swraj Paul and Raja Ram Bhasin
& Co. to cooperate by appearing before the court. We think that they should also be liable for a
portion of the costs. So also the Punjab National Bank. The appeals filed by the Union of India, the
Life Insurance Corporation of India and the Reserve Bank of India are allowed with costs payable as
follows : Three-fifths of the taxed costs in each case will be payable by Har Prasad Nanda, one-fifth
by Swraj Paul and one-fifth by the Punjab National Bank. The cross appeal filed by Escorts Limited
and Nanda is dismissed with the costs of the Union of India, the RESERVE Bank of India and the
Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Union of India, the Reserve Bank of India and the Life
Insurance Corporation of India are entitled to their costs in the High Court, three-fifths payable by
Nanda, one-fifth by Swraj Paul and one-fifth by Punjab National Bank. In modification of our order
dt. 4.4.85 in C.M.P No. 12832/85, we direct Shri H.P. Nanda and Rajan Nanda to continue as

22,"Periyaiya Servai and Muthu Servai, were the sons of Marimuthu Servai. Periyaiya Servai had three sons, being
the first and second defendants and Marimuthu, who is no longer alive and whose wife Poomayil has also died. The
plaintiff, first and second defendants and late Marimuthu have onefourth share each in the joint family properties.
That Periyaiya Servai through his first wife, Veeramakali Ammal ( since deceased) had four daughters and a son,
being the first defendant, namely, P.R. Ramasamy. Through his second wife, Kaliammal, Periyaiya Servai had two
sons, being second defendant, namely, P.R. Kasilingam and Marimuthu. Second defendant's son, K. Arumuga
Velaiya is the plaintiff.

According to the plaintiff, Periyaiya Servai had executed a registered will dated 26th January, 1994, in favour of
the plaintiff in relation to his share of the properties of the joint family. Thus, the joint family properties had to be
divided into four shares of which the plaintiff was entitled to one share, bequeathed in his favour by his grandfather,
Periyaiya Servai under the will. Further, Poomayil, on the death of her husband Marimuthu had bequeathed his share
in the property to the first defendant. Hence the first defendant has become entitled to half share in the joint family
property and the remaining half has to be equally divided between the second defendant and the plaintiff. That the
first defendant sent a legal notice objecting to plaintiff's share in the suit schedule properties, which are joint family
properties. Therefore, the plaintiff has been constrained to file a suit for partition and separate possession.

The nanjai, punjai and accessories viz Thitthuthidal, cattle, chickens, vessels and all other household articles are
to be divided into three equal shares.
As the Panchayatdars unanimously decide that the three acres of land out of the total common Nanjai lands are to
be left to the care of Ramasamy, the eldest Son, the said three acres of Nanjai Lands are to be accordingly given
away to Ramasamy.",Respondent

our opinion, it falls under Principles No.3 and 4(a) mentioned above. Though the copies of the
statements of two witnesses [Kaur Singh, Patwari and Balwant Singh] were not furnished, the
respondent was permitted to peruse them and take notes therefrom more than three days prior to
their examination. Of the two witnesses, Balwant Singh was not examined and only Kaur Singh was
examined. The respondent did not raise any objection during the enquiry that the non-furnishing of
the copies of the statements is disabling him or has disabled him, as the case may be, from
effectively cross- examining the witnesses or to defend himself. The Trial Court has not found that
any prejudice has resulted from the said violation. The Appellate Court has no doubt said that it has
prejudiced the respondent's case but except merely mentioning the same, it has not specified in
what manner and in what sense was the respondent prejudiced in his defence. The High Court, of
course, has not refereed to aspect of prejudice at all.
For the above reasons, we hold that no prejudice has resulted to the respondent on account of not
furnishing him the copies of the statements of witnesses. We are satisfied that on account of the said
violations it cannot he said that the respondent did not have a fair hearing or that the disciplinary

44,"19. In view of the legal position which we have referred to aforesaid, these continuing acts of the respondent would
amount to cruelty even if the same had not arisen as a cause prior to the institution of the petition, as was found by
the Trial Court. This conduct shows disintegration of marital unity and thus disintegration of the marriage. (A.
Jayachandra v. Aneel Kaur, (2005) 2 SCC 22). In fact, there was no initial integration itself which would allow
disintegration afterwards. The fact that there have been continued allegations and litigative proceedings and that can
amount to cruelty is an aspect taken note of by this court. (Malathi Ravi v. B.V. Ravi, (2014) 7 SCC 640) The
marriage having not taken of from its inception and 5 years having been spent in the Trial Court, it is difficult to
accept that the marriage soon after the decree of divorce, within 6 days, albeit 6 years after the initial inception of
marriage, amounts to conduct which can be held against the appellant.
20. In the conspectus of all the aforesaid facts, this is one case where both the ground of irretrievable breakdown of
marriage and the ground of cruelty on account of subsequent facts would favour the grant of decree of divorce in
favour of the appellant.
21. We are, thus, of the view that a decree of divorce dissolving the marriage between the parties be passed not only
in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage,
but also on account of cruelty under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Act in light of the subsequent conduct of the respondent
during the pendency of judicial proceedings at various stages.

ground of sickness of his father was dismissed on 11.02.2022. Instant petition though has been filed
seeking release of petitioner on regular bail, however, one of the grounds urged is alleged sickness of
his father. The petitioner has placed on record an unsigned computerized form. According to
learned counsel for the petitioner, in terms of this form, petitioner's father, aged about 56 years, has
been referred by ECHS, Shimla on 20.12.2022 for further treatment to any ECHS Empanelled

petitioner's father requires petitioner's physical presence for the illness alleged to be suffered by
him. The nature and extent of alleged illness of petitioner's father is also not clear from this
document.

55,"Moreover, in the present case, there was no parent order under Section 27 of the 1986 Act, to justify the
issuance of a warrant of arrest against the decree-holder/petitioners. In the absence of an adjudication under Section
27, such issuance of warrant to ensure presence of any parties was de hors the law.
55.Over and above such illegality, the impugned order of issuance of arrest warrant against the petitioners is vitiated
in view of the previous appearance of the petitioners in connection with the execution application before the Forum
on several occasions. Once the defaulting party appears before the Forum, the justification behind the issuance of a
warrant of arrest to ensure presence of such party pales into insignificance. The impugned order was passed beyond
the jurisdiction of the Forum on such score as well.
56. In the present case, a composite application under Sections 25 and 27 of the 1986 Act was made. However, the
said two sections retain their independent scope of operation and cannot be used as substitutes of each other. The
specific modality provided in Section 25 ought to have been exhausted by the Forum for execution of its order, before
taking resort to issuance of a warrant of arrest unnecessarily.
57.Even from a different perspective, the impugned order directing arrest warrant to be issued was not passed within
the contemplation of Section 27, which envisages an order of imprisonment and/or fine and does not deal with
issuance of arrest warrants to ensure appearance of parties, particularly when they have already entered
appearance before the Forum.

Resultantly an obligation has been imposed on the transferee of the promissory notes, to be deemed to be a 'Holder

about the holder's title. In the present case, while the Shankar Lal Saraf's (holder) title over the Bonds/Promissory
Notes is not in dispute but as discussed earlier, Shankar Lal Saraf's holding stood cleared by the Company Court
only on 17.12.2004 but before the said judgment, there was a cloud over his title. Consequently, the plaintiff's status
as 'holder in due course' was suspect at the relevant point of time.
 The defendant bank was therefore justified in withholding payment till conclusion of dispute in Company Court,
even though the relief claimed was in respect of an 'unconditional undertaking', as there were reasonable legal
concerns for the transaction during the suspect spell, for making such payments.",Respondent
57,"Reverting back to the situation here, the Revenue does not contend that the Assessee Banks had held the
securities for maintaining the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), as mentioned in the circular. In view of this position,
when there is no finding that the investments of the Assessee are of the related category, tax implication would not
arise against the appellants, from the said circular.
 The aforesaid discussion and the cited judgments advise this Court to conclude that the proportionate
disallowance of interest is not warranted, under Section 14A of Income Tax Act for investments made in tax free
bonds/ securities which yield tax free dividend and interest to Assessee Banks in those situations where, interest free
own funds available with the Assessee, exceeded their investments. With this conclusion, we unhesitatingly agree
with the view taken by the learned ITAT favouring the assessees.

 The above conclusion is reached because nexus has not been established between expenditure disallowed and
earning of exempt income. The respondents as earlier noted, have failed to substantiate their argument that
assessee was required to maintain separate accounts. Their reliance on Honda Siel (Supra) to project such an
obligation on the assessee, is already negated. The learned counsel for the revenue has failed to refer to any
statutory provision which obligate the assessee to maintain separate accounts which might justify proportionate
disallowance.

Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily Diary is the record of all information received in a police station, we direct that all information relating to cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily and meticulously reflected in the said Diary and the decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be reflected, as mentioned above.
With the above directions, we dispose of the reference made to us. List all the matters before the appropriate Bench for disposal on merits.",Ambiguity
63,"In view of the fact that this is a case of circumstantial evidence and further in view of the fact that two views are possible on the evidence on record, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other his innocence, the accused is entitled to have the benefit of one which is favourable to him. In that view of the matter I agree with my learned brothers that the guilt of the accused has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.",Petitioner
64,"In the present case, we are of the opinion that the material on record does not disclose a prima facie case calling for an investigation by the CBI. The mere allegation of the appellant that his son was murdered because he had discovered some corruption cannot, in our opinion, justify a CBI inquiry, particularly when inquiries were held by the Army authorities as well as by the G.R.P. at Mathura, which revealed that it was a case of suicide.
It has been stated in the impugned order of the High Court that the G.R.P. at Mathura had investigated the matter and gave a detailed report on 29.8.2003. It is not clear whether this report was accepted by the Magistrate or not. If the report has been accepted by the Magistrate and no appeal/revision was filed against the order of the learned Magistrate accepting the police report, then that is the end of the matter. However, if the Magistrate has not yet passed any order on the police report, he may do so in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above.",Respondent
65,"On an overall view of the facts as indicated hereinabove and keeping in mind the decision of this Court in B.S. Joshi's case (supra) and the compromise arrived at between the Company and the Bank as also clause 11 of the consent terms filed in the suit filed by the Bank, we are satisfied that this is a fit case where technicality should not be allowed to stand in the way in the quashing of the criminal proceedings, since, in our view, the continuance of the same after the compromise arrived at between the parties would be a futile exercise.
We, therefore, set aside the order passed by the High Court dismissing the petitioner's revision application No.49 of 2003 in Special Case No.80 of 1998 and quash the proceedings against the appellant. The appeal is accordingly allowed.",Respondent
66,"Material on record shows that the respondent has admitted her child in a convent at Ooty. Though it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the child is a hostler and therefore, the respondent has not extended her love and affection, it is not uncommon that many students are studying in hostels and Boarding Schools and that cannot be a reason to contend that the mother has no love and affection towards the child.
Pleadings disclose that in order to improve the performance of the child in sports activities, the respondent has shifted him from one school to another and that itself would show the love and affection of the mother, in developing the child's interest in the field, in which, he has shown excellence. It is now well settled that the Court can consider the views of the minors also in deciding the custody and guardianship. Record of proceedings shows that in the instant case, the child has been enquired and that he has expressed happiness and desire to be with the respondent-mother. Though the respondent got remarried in the year 2006, there is absolutely no complaint from the child that re-marriage has affected his mental condition or education. The child has been living with the respondent for so many years and uprooting the custody and separating the child from the mother at this length of time, would certainly affect the education and mental condition of the child.
In view of the above discussion, this Court considered is of the view that the lower Court has considered the paramount welfare of the child, in all respects and accordingly, found that the custody and guardianship should be retained with the mother of the child. There is no manifest illegality. The Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions are also closed.",Respondent
67,"Taking an overall view of the aforesaid facts of the present case, the judicial conscious of the court impels us to disbelieve and disagree with the finding of the learned trial court holding the appellant guilty of committing rape of his daughter in the month of November - December 2006. The evidence produced by the prosecution and even the medical evidence does not lead us to believe that the appellant had committed a rape of his daughter.
In view of the aforesaid discussions, the appeal filed by the appellant is allowed and the judgment passed by the learned trial court is set aside. It is ordered accordingly.
The appellant is in custody and he be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.",Petitioner
68,"In this case, this Court is of the view that this is one of the appropriate cases where a suitable direction to be issued to the State Government to pay the compensation. Accordingly, the Home Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu is directed to pay compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- to the victim within three months from today.
Since the sentence imposed upon the appellants (A1 to A4) has been enhanced to life imprisonment, the appellants are directed to surrender before the trial Court or the trial Court is directed to take steps to secure the custody of the appellants/accused to undergo the remaining period of sentence.
With these observations, the appeals as well as the revision are disposed of.",Respondent
69,"For the reasons give above, we maintain the death sentence awarded to Dharampal and Nirmal along with fine imposed upon them as they snuffed out five innocent lives and brought about the total elumination of the line of Tale, their co-village. Snuffing out the lives of five innocent persons did not take place on account of some provocation in the heat of moment, but it was a premeditated and calculated act executed by them through a chalked out plan at night time thinking that the ghastly, barbaric and brute murders might go unnoticed and the police might work on the theory that these are blind murders. They do not deserve any leniency. So, death sentence passed upon them is confirmed. Fine imposed is also maintained. Entire amount of fine if recovered, shall go to Nirmala and Punam alias Bimla, daughters of Tale. Criminal Appeal fails and is dismissed. Murder reference is answered in the affirmative.",Petitioner
70,"In view of the above, we do not find any reason to interfere with the well reasoned judgment and order of the High Court. The facts of the case do not warrant review of the findings recorded by the courts below.
The appeals lack merit and are accordingly dismissed.",Respondent
71,"So far as offence under section 354 of the IPC is concerned, almost all material witnesses have made consistent statements on the aforesaid occurrence and, in my opinion, the prosecution succeeded to prove the charge under section 354 of the IPC.
Appellant has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year under section 354 of the IPC and from perusal of the lower court record, it would appear that the appellant was remanded in the case on 24.4.1998 and remained in custody till 21.8.1999. Furthermore, I find that after prouncement of judgment of conviction, the appellant was taken in custody on 18.10.2001 and he remained in custody till 21.1.2002 and, therefore, in my view, the period already undergone by the appellant during the course of trial as well as during the pendency of the appeal shall meet the ends of justice.
On the basis of the aforesaid discussions, this criminal appeal is partly, allowed and the conviction of the appellant for the offences under sections 366 and 376 of the IPC is, hereby, set aside and so far as conviction of the appellant under section 354 of the IPC is concerned, the same is confirmed but the sentence awarded to him under section 354 of the IPC is reduced to the already period undergone by him in course of trial as well as during the pendency of the appeal.",Ambiguity
72,"Having considered the given facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in mind the parameters laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decisions cited AB No. 8 of 2022 P a g e | 27 above and also the gravity of the offence, this Court is of the view that the petitioner cannot be granted anticipatory bail in this case.
In the result, the anticipatory bail application is dismissed. The interim order already granted by this Court is vacated.
It is made clear that the observations made in this order are limited to the question of considering the anticipatory bail to the petitioner and this Court has not delved into the merits of the offences levelled against the petitioner.",Respondent
73,"This Court declares that Section 27(3) of Arms Act, 1959 is ultra vires the Constitution and is declared void. The appeal is thus dismissed on merits and the High Court judgment acquitting the respondent is affirmed.",Respondent
74,"Coming now to the facts of this case the Trial Court acquit- ted the co-accused but convicted the appellant under section 302, IPC. The High Court has confirmed that conviction. Mr. Lalit is right when he says that the prosecution evidence does not disclose that the fatal blow which caused injury No. 1 was given by the appellant. Inherent of this submission is the assumption that the fatal blow was given by someone else. That establishes the fact that more that one person partici- pated in the commission of the crime. We have also on an independent appreciation of the evidence of the three eye witnesses, namely, PW 1 Komal Chand, PW 3 Kishan Lal and PW 4 Ramesh, come to the conclusion that several persons had participated in the commission of the crime. The failure on the part of the prosecution witnesses PWs 3 and 4 to identi- fy the others does not alter the situation. We are, on the other hand, convinced from the evidence of PW 1 Komal Chand that some of the co-accused, particularly, Gunda, Parsu and Gopal had participated in the commission of the crime. It is another matter that in the absence of a State appeal the High Court could not, nor can we, interfere with their acquittal, but as rightly'pointed in Brathi's case this Court is not bound by the facts found proved on the appreci- ation of evidence by the courts below and is, in law, enti- tled to reach its own conclusion different from the one recorded by the court's below on a review of the evidence. In that view of the matter we think that the conviction of the appellant can be sustained with the aid of section 34 or 149, IPC, as the case may be. In the present case we feel it safe to confirm the conviction of the appellant with the aid of section 34, IPC. We, therefore, cannot agree with the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that at best the conviction can be recorded under section 324, IPC. We confirm the conviction of the appellant under section 302, IPC, with the aid of section 34 and maintain the sen- tence awarded to him.For the above reasons we see no merit in this appeal and dismiss the same.",Respondent
75,"In view of the above, all the appeals are dismissed. So far as Nedu @ Nedunchezhian (A.2), Madhu @ Ravindran (A.3) and C. Muniappan (A.4) are concerned, sentence of death imposed on them is confirmed and the same be executed in accordance with law.

However, in Criminal Appeal Nos.1632-1634 of 2010 (arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 1482-1484 of 2008), the sentences are reduced as undergone. All of them are on bail, their bail bonds stand discharged. These criminal appeals stand disposed of accordingly.",Respondent
76,"The fact that there has to be clear evidence of the guilt of the accused and that in the absence of that it is not possible to record a finding of his guilt was stressed by this Court in the case of Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade & Anr. (supra) as is clear from the following observations :
""Certainly it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distinction between 'may be' and 'must be' is long and divides vague conjectures from sure considerations"".
As a result of the above, we accept the appeal, set aside the judgments of the. trial court and the High Court and acquit the accused.

Appeal allowed.",Petitioner
77,"That is the only way to have the record corrected. If no such step is taken, the matter must necessarily end there. Of course a party may resile and an Appellate Court may permit him in rare and appropriate cases to resile from a concession on the ground that the concession was made on a wrong appreciation of the law and had led to gross injustice; but, he may not call in question the very fact of making the concession as recorded in the judgment.""For the aforementioned reasons , there is no merit in these appeals which are dismissed. However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.",Respondent
78,"It was contended by Dr. Singhvi that the acquisition was really for the cooperative housing societies which are companies within the definition of the word company' in s. 3(e) of the Act, and, therefore, the provisions of Part VII of the Act should have been complied with. Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court were of the view that the acquisition was not for company. We see no reason to differ from their view. The mere fact that after the acquisition the Government proposed to hand over, or, in fact, handed over, a portion of the property acquired for development to the cooperative housing societies would not make the acquisition one for company'. Nor are we satisfied that there is any merit in the contention that compensation to be paid for the acquisition came from the consideration paid by the cooperative societies. In the light of the averments in the counter affidavit filed in the writ petitions here, it is difficult to hold that it was cooperatives which provided the fund for the acquisition. Merely because the Government allotted a part of the property to cooperative societies for development, it would not follow that the acquisition was for cooperative societies, and therefore, Part VII of the Act was attracted. It may be noted that the validity of the notification under s. 4 and the declaration under s. 6 was in issue in Udai Ram Sharma and Others v. Union of India(1) and this Court upheld their validity.
We see no merit in the appeals and the writ petitions. They are, therefore, dismissed with costs.

80,"In this case, we have concurrent finding by two Courts below to the effect that in the absence of any complaint by the Election Commissioner, the complaint of the Petitioner is hit by Section 195(1)(a) CrPC. In a proceeding under Section 482, the High Court will not enter into any finding of facts, particularly, when the matter has been concluded by concurrent finding of facts of two courts below. Such powers can be exercised to secure ends of justice, prevent abuse of the process of any court and to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, depending upon the facts of a given case. After taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that the present petition invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 CrPC is just to satisfy the personal vendetta by the Petitioner, the inherent power of this Court cannot be exercised in such type of cases.",Respondent

Resultantly, we allow this appeal and set aside judgment of acquittal dated April 19, 2001 passed by learned Judge, Special Court, Patiala. Respondent is convicted for the commission of offence punishable under Section 18 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. In this case, heavy quantity of opium is suggestive of the fact that he has been commercially dealing in narcotics. Such a person is not only an enemy of the nation but also a destroyer of the human race.

84,"In view of the fact that none of the eye witnesses have supported the case of the prosecution and in view of the fact that even the corroborative piece of evidence such as evidence relating to seizure mahazars is unbelievable, the trial court is justified in acquitting the accused.

Appeal fails and the same is dismissed.",Respondent
85,"A perusal of these depositions reveal a complete denial of the statements recorded by the police, thereby leaving no option with the trial court but to acquit the respondents.

The order dated 30.05.2011 vide which now the name of the applicant has been brought on the secret list of doubtful integrity is also set aside.

153,"A very reading of the above averments would clearly indicate that they are bald. Even as per the evidence of the petitioner, the average polling in any parliamentary constituency was 55 to 60%; but, in the election in question, the polling was 61.19%. Admittedly, when the political parties faced the 14th Lok Sabha General Elections, they aligned themselves into two pre-poll formations namely DPA and NDA. The DPA was headed by DMK, and the NDA was headed by AIADMK. The entire electioneering was done by the two major pre-poll formations, and hence, it cannot be stated that it was not made known to the public that to which alignment, a particular political party and movement belonged. In the instant case, there is nothing to infer that there was any confusion prevailed in the mind of the electorates. In the face of the poll percentage of 61.19, which even according to the petitioner, fell excess than the usual percentage of the poll in the elections in the past, the contention that large number of voters have abstained from voting, and if the voting during that election, was on higher percentage, the defeated candidate would have become successful cannot be accepted. It is also noticed that the margin between the returned candidate and the defeated candidate was 1,78,610, and hence, at no stretch of imagination, it can be held that the election petitioner has made the requisite pleadings either, or demonstrated by sufficient proof that the result of the election of the second respondent has been materially affected by the non-compliance of the provisions of the Act. In such circumstances, the petitioner cannot seek a declaration that the election of the returned candidate is void, since he has miserably failed to prove that there was either improper acceptance of the nomination or as a consequence, the election insofar as it concerned the second respondent, has been materially affected. Hence, the above issues are answered accordingly.",Respondent
154,"We also are of the view that, Doordarshan all through the present matter has been displaying a sad reluctance in telecasting this film, which was made almost ten years ago. We can trace a history of Doordarshan not telecasting many films in spite of them being award winning films at the national and international level, this can be seen in the case of films like ""In Memory of Friends"", ""Ram ke Naam"" etc. In addition an interesting observation that can be arrived is that Doordarshan has been finding flimsy excuses time and again as clear from the facts in not telecasting the documentary film in question every time the film was sought to be aired either at the instance of the respondent or due to the orders of the court. This in our view in highly irrational and is blatant violation of the right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. This behavior of Doordarshan would justify us in stating that Doordarshan is being dictated by rules of malafides and arbitrariness in taking decisions with regard to In light of the above, the instant appeal at the instance of Doordarshan is devoid of any merits.

155,"The appellant herein contested an election held on 29.6.2003 to the post of Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat of Village Bareh, Tehsil Budhlada in the State of Punjab. The appellant herein was declared elected. He won by a margin of 11 votes. The 1st respondent filed an election petition, inter alia, contending that while counting the ballot papers, 147 votes were wrongly rejected. It was further averred that the counting staff headed by the Presiding Officer intermingled about 25 ballots, which were polled in his favour in the bundles of the elected candidate and had the said votes been counted in his favour he would have been declared elected. By reason of an order dated 29.6.2004, the Election Tribunal directed recounting of the ballot papers. The validity of the said order was questioned by the appellant herein by filing a revision application before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, which was numbered as Civil Revision No.3194 of 2004. By reason of the impugned judgment, the said revision application has been dismissed. The 1st respondent was found to have made out a prima facie case for recounting of votes by both the Tribunal and also the High Court on the premise that a large number of votes might have wrongly been rejected. The margin of votes polled by the appellant vis-`-vis the 1st respondent, although would not be of much relevance but the said fact alone was not the basis for passing the impugned judgment. The 1st respondent herein not only lodged protests in regard to the manner in which the Presiding Officer counted the votes, but had also urged him to recount the votes. He had also given specific instances in respect thereof in his election petition. The Election Petitioner, furthermore, not only placed necessary facts in his election petition but also in his deposition before the Tribunal categorically stated that the Presiding Officer did not assign any reason for declaring a huge number of votes as invalid. We have noticed hereinbefore that before the Tribunal a contention had been raised by the 1st respondent that 25 votes polled in his favour were wrongly counted in favour of the appellant by intermingling them with the ballot papers. We, therefore, are satisfied that the conditions precedent necessary for a direction of recounting of votes stand satisfied.",Respondent

165,"This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner Arvind Pareek with the prayer that respondents be directed to declare the notification dated 31.7.2003 illegal to the extent it keeps the sportsman who have participated at International level and National Level tournaments at the same pedestal. It has also been prayed that the policy laid down under the said notification dated 31.7.2003 be declared illegal being unjust arbitrary and discriminatory to the extent it keeps the sportsman who have simply participated at State Level or National Level Tournaments at par with those sports persons who have not only participated but even won the Medals or acquired a high rank in the State, National or International Tournaments. A further direction may be issued to the respondents to provide additional incentives in the form of bonus marks while making appointment on the post of Physical Training Instructor Grade II as well as Physical Training Instructor Grade III to the sports persons who have participated in International Level tournaments and also to the sportsman who have won the medals or ranked high in the State, National on International Tournaments. It is essentially a matter of policy for the Government to decide whether or not to give any bonus marks on the basis of participation in sports tournaments and if the Government decides to give such benefits, it is also the prerogative of the State to extend such benefits on certain prescribed conditions. In extending the benefit of bonus marks to all those who participate in State and National Tournaments and not just to those who win medals. Object of the policy appears to be to boost participation in such sports meets and cover a larger section and more number of candidates. The policy however is the domain of the Government and not of the courts. If the Government has decided to broadly categorize the sports persons in two classes, namely, those who participate in State Level Tournaments and those who participate at the National Level Tournaments, whether or not-there should be a third category is exclusively for the Government to decide. What should be the extent of the total bonus marks and outer limit for awarding such marks has also to be decided by the Government. If the Government has provided that the candidate would be entitled to the maximum 15 marks on the basis of best of the certificates produced by him, the court by its judicial fiat cannot require it to increase such limit or provide for a separate category. The outer limit of the marks appears to have been fixed on the rational of ensuring that the element of merit in the competition is not completely eliminated and the incentive is confined to a reasonable limit. In my considered view, this Court in its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India cannot interfere in such policy matter.

We need not go into the said judgments as the basic principle settled in the citations is that the question of malafides has to be decided on the facts of each case. At the outset, we reiterate that credentiality of the complainant at this stage is not relevant. As stated above, in this case, what is alleged by the complaint, inter alia, is that he was a privy to the discussions and consultations and thinking which went into making of the mutual wills and the mutual trusts; that, he was a formal witness to some of these deeds and that he was aware that the couple had mutually agreed to the disposal of the property to charity after their demise. In the facts and circumstances of this case, at this stage, we are not inclined to accept the argument that the complaint should be dismissed at the initial stage on the ground of alleged malafides of the complainant. We reiterate that our observations in the judgment should not be read as our opinion on the merits of the matter. Similarly, the applicability of the relevant section to the facts of the present case does not arise at this stage. For the above reasons, we find no merit in these appeals and the same are accordingly dismissed.",Respondent
167,"In my view, therefore, the decision taken by the respondents under order dated 25.1.2006 (Annexure R/1/1) runs contrary to the mandate and the spirit of the Rules 24 and the circular dated 27.7.1982 (Annexure 2) and consequently, the same deserves to be quashed and set aside, international event is an international event which is recognised as such by the Sports Council and the said body in the case of the petitioner has recognised the achievement of the petitioner to be of an international level and it cannot be left to the respondents to sit in judgment over the decision of the Sports Council. This writ petition is consequently allowed. The order dated 25.1.2006 (Annexure R/1/1) and the order dated 21.4.1998 (Annexure 6) are hereby quashed and set aside. The respondents are directed to given possession of the land to the petitioner in accordance with the orders Annexure 3, 4 and 5. Since the matter has remained pending for last 12 years since the allotment was made by the Government itself, the respondents are directed to give possession of the land to the petitioner within a period of three months of submission of the certified copy.",Petitioner
168,"The petitioners, an Association of victims of the Uphaar tragedy (AYUT), have filed these petitions; one under Section 439(2) read with Section 482 Page 1927 PC seeking cancellation of bail of the respondents/accused persons; namely Mr.Sushil Ansal, Mr.Gopal Ansal and Mr.H.S.Panwar, who along with others, are facing trial for the offence under Sections 304/304A/337/338/36 IPC read with Section 14 of the Cinematograph Act in a case pending before the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi; and the other under Section 482 CrPC for a direction/ or registration of a criminal case (FIR ) against the offenders for tampering with the documents in judicial custody. For the reasons stated above, in the result Crl.M.(M) 2380/2003 seeking cancellation of bail of respondents No. 1 to 3 is dismissed and Crl.M.2229/2006 is hereby allowed and the Special Branch of Delhi Police is called upon to register a case under appropriate provisions of law in regard to the incident of removal / tampering with/mutilation of the documents, referred to above, from the judicial record of the Trial Court. After registration of the FIR, investigation shall be entrusted to an officer not below the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police who will conduct the investigation expeditiously and endeavor to conclude the same within a period of three months from the date of this order. A status report shall be filed by the investigating agency before the next date of hearing. Observations made in this order are based on a prima facie view of the facts and circumstances brought before the Court and may not be construed as the expression of opinion in regard to the complicity of one or the other person.",Respondent
169,"Now let us examine the merits of FIR No. 400/2000 dated 12.12.2000 registered under Section 325/34 IPC. In this case too, the applicant, who was an accused was acquitted on the ground that the informant in the aforesaid case had deposed that he does not want to continue this case since he has compromised with the present applicant. The Court has granted a permission to compound the offence and accordingly the applicant was acquitted. After acquittal of the applicant, the question now arises for our consideration is whether the respondent-authorities could proceed against him on the self same ground of acquisition without filing an independent complaint before the respondent-authorities. The complainant in FIR No. 400/2000 has sought permission to compound the offence and accordingly the Court had also granted the same. Consequently the applicant was acquitted of the charges. In that view of the matter there has been no fresh complaint by the informant in FIR No. 400/2000. Even if the police officer is acquitted, it is open to the respondent-authorities that the Deputy Commissioner of Police has to record reasons that the prosecution witnesses have been won over. In this case, there is nothing on record to show that the Deputy Commissioner of Police has recorded such an opinion that the prosecution witnesses have been won over. Therefore, the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings on the self same ground appears to be untenable in law. Further more, this was an incident of 2000 and the applicant retired on 31.1.2005 from service. In this view of the matter, this is an incident four years prior to the date of his retirement. Considering the case of the applicant from any angle, we find that the respondents are not justified in initiating departmental proceedings by asking him to show cause vide letter dated 20.5.2005 (Annexure. A/1 (Colly.)). Accordingly, the present Original Application succeeds. Impugned order dated 20.5.2005 is quashed. No costs.",Ambiguity
170,"In view of aforesaid discussion it can very well be gathered that though there was excess expenditure in the installation of tube well, but there is no mens rea or willful default which may be said to be disqualification under Sub-section (5) of the Act. It is apparent that petitioner after depositing the amount on 25-11-2000 before the Sub Divisional Officer, has not attained any disqualification in the matter. Thus the prescribed authority by the impugned order has wrongly recorded finding that petitioner who accepted guilt and deposited the amount before the authority shall be treated as a disqualification for a period of 6 years. This finding can not be sustained under law and the election of petitioner has been wrongly declared as void by the authority. Consequently, this petition is allowed. The order Annexure P-7 is quashed. The petitioner shall be entitled to continue as Sarpanch of Gram Panchayat, Siloda and for costs of this petition, which is quantified Rs. 1,000/-(Rupees one thousand only) payable by respondent No. 3 to the petitioner.",Petitioner
171,"The marriage between petitioner and first respondent was solemnized in 1995 and out of wedlock two children were born, in February, 2000 respondent filed an application for dissolution of marriage under Section 13 of Hindu Marriages Act (hereinafter called as ""the Act"") which was contested by parties till 21st January, 2004 when they filed a joint application under Section 15 of the Act for divorce by mutual consent. On the same day on request of appearing counsel, learned trial Judge (Additional District Judge, Matrimonial/Cases, Jammu) referred the matter for settlement to Lok Adalat which was constituted on 27.1.2004. In acceptance of the joint request for divorce by mutual consent the Lok Adalat awarded a divorce decree while allowing custody of children to remain with respondent-father. Aggrieved by award of Lok Adalat, the petitioner has instituted this writ petition to have the same quashed on the grounds that respondent threatened and coerced her into signing the petition for divorce by mutual consent and won over her Advocate to manage the impugned award from concerned Lok Adalat, which was bad for want of proper observance of the requirement of Section 15 of the Act, besides being incompetent for want of jurisdiction on past of Lok Adalat to take cognizance of the matter. It is also alleged that even the reference made by learned trial Judge to Lok Adalat was bad because with presentation of the allegedly consented application for divorce no dispute survived between the parties which could be referred for settlement. Materials appended with memo of petition are the copies of impugned order and statements of parties as recorded by Lok Adalat and other applications purporting to have been filed before the trial court from time to time. Accordingly for all that has been stated above, the petition is disposed of with a direction that the divorce awarded by Lok Adalat shall stand overset. The reference made by trial court to the Lok Adalat would be deemed to have been one under Sub-section (3) of Section 29 of HM Act and the proceedings of Lok Adalat, a report in terms thereof that may be used by trial court for pronouncement upon the petition for divorce by mutual consent, which shall stand transmitted back to him alongwith proceedings taken by Lok Adalat in the matter. During consideration of the matter he shall, however, take all the factual pleas and counter pleas raised by parties into account including respondent's claim of having paid Rs. 4.00 lacs to petitioner and dispose of the matter and dispose of the matter in accordance with law, positively within a period of two months from now.

172,"This writ petition has been filed by a Society through its Secretary. It is stated in the petition that the Society was established in the year 1993 with the object of development of health education among women. The Society is running Paramedical and health institutions in Andhra Pradesh. Object of the Society is to develop medical education. The Society is interested in starting a medical college in Ranga Reddy District and it was waiting for a notification with regard to the establishment of a medical college especially for women. As there was no notification issued by the Government, the Society submitted an application on 27.5.2003 addressed to the Principal Secretary, Health, Medical and Family Welfare Department. There was no response to the application, but the petitioner learnt that the Government was considering an application filed by one Dr.V.R.K. Educational Society. The petitioner issued a notice on 25.1.2005 to the Government not to proceed in the matter in contravention of regulations of Medical Council of India and G.O. Ms. No. 250, dated 22.5.1992 and G.O. Ms. No. 128, dated 30.4.1998. The Government was also informed through the notice, about the judgment of Supreme Court in Government of A.P. v. Medwin Educational Society, No reply was given to the notice. Besides what has been stated by us hereinabove, we are also doubtful about the bona fides of the petitioner, as it has been contended specifically by respondent No. 5 in his counter-affidavit that Smt. N. Renuka, who sworn in as Secretary of the petitioner-Society, is not Secretary of that Society, and it has not even been controverted by the petitioner. For these reasons, we do not find merit in this writ petition, which is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.",Respondent
173,"No question of law, far less any substantial question of law arises for our consideration. We may however briefly reflect upon a submission made by learned Counsel for the Respondent to the effect that the assessed had, by its letter dated March 8, 1999 requested the AO to examine the Assessment Records of the share applicants whose GR Nos. had been supplied. It is not controverter that action was not taken by the AO, but it has justifiably been contended that this inaction was due to paucity of time left at that stage since the assessment had to be framed by March 31, 1999. It has been pointed out that several adjournments had been granted by the Assessment Officer on the asking of the assessed. The timing of the assesseds said letter is most suspect. Generally speaking, it is incumbent on the AO to manage his schedule, while granting adjournments, in such a manner that he does not run out of time for discharging the duties cast on him by the statute. In the present case the details had been furnished to the AO much before March 1999 but he failed to react to the shifting of the burden to investigate into the creditworthiness of the share applicants. Therefore, the Appeal is dismissed.",Respondent
174,"For the reasons aforesaid, the writ petition deserves to be partly allowed. Keeping in view totality of facts and circumstances, in our considered view, the ends of justice would be met if we hold the Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme, 2002 (ECHS) to be legal, valid, intra vires and constitutional but direct the respondent-Government either to waive the amount of contribution or to pay such amount on behalf those ex- servicemen who retired prior to January 1, 1996 and who intend to avail medical facilities and benefits under the said scheme by exercising option by becoming members of ECHS. In other words, it is open to ex- defence personnel, who retired prior to January 1, 1996 to become members of ECHS and to claim medical facilities and benefits under the said scheme without payment of contribution amount.

Aggrieved by the said order the petitioner has filed this writ petition. Besides this, what is surprising is that when the election petition was filed in September, 2005, the application for recounting was filed only on 14.12.2005 i.e. after more than six months. The order of recounting had been passed on 27.4.2006, with the direction that recounting may commence from 29.4.2006.
